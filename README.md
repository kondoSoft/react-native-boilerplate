# React Native Boilerplate

A Kondo Soft initiative by Carlos Gonzalez

A simple cross platform boilerplate for native UI for both Android and IOS

## Why?

React Native is huge and beautiful, but we don't have a boilerplate that fills the need of a customisable yet cross platform and out of the box implementation of cross platform Native UI

##Inspired by...

@geekyants Native Base



##Based on
